// uhh this is how you do a note in c++ 
#include <iostream> // do like no matter what lol
using namespace std; //use if you need to print out a lot of stuff :P

int number; // create variables with this, like int a, int b, etc
number= 200; // define the variables in the main line of code 

cout << "print my favorite number please \n " << number << endl; // Use \n to make another line in cout functions 
cout << "\n thats correct nice job computer" << endl;
